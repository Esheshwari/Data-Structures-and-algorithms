Introduction
Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that play a crucial role in designing efficient and effective software. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving complex problems and optimizing the performance of applications.

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone the project to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-algorithms.git
cd data-structures-algorithms
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install it from here.

Data Structures
Arrays
Arrays are a collection of elements, each identified by an index or key. They provide fast access to elements but have fixed size.

Example:
python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Linked Lists
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

Example:
python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data)
        if not self.head:
            self.head = new_node
        else:
            current = self.head
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = new_node
Stacks
Stacks are a collection of elements that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added is the first to be removed.

Example:
python
stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.pop()  # 2
Queues
Queues are a collection of elements that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.

Example:
python
from collections import deque
queue = deque([1, 2, 3])
queue.append(4)
queue.popleft()  # 1
Trees
Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root node and child nodes. Each node represents a value, and edges represent the connections between nodes.

Example:
python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
Graphs
Graphs are a collection of nodes connected by edges. They can be used to represent networks, social connections, and more.

Example:
python
graph = { 
    'A' : ['B','C'],
    'B' : ['D', 'E'],
    'C' : ['F'],
    'D' : [],
    'E' : ['F'],
    'F' : []
}
Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Example:
python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
Quick Sort
Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.

Example:
python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
        return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)
Search Algorithms
Linear Search
Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks each element in the list until the target value is found.

Example:
python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Example:
python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1
